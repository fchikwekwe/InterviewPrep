"""				Lyft Interview Question : Islands

Given a Multidimensional array, return the number of island clusters where land
is represented by 1 and water by 0. A cluster of islands is defined by a 1 or
pack of one enclosed by 0â€™s left and right, NOT diagonally.

Example:

0110
0100   => 3 because we have 3 packs of 1â€™s
1000
0011

Note from interviewer: You donâ€™t have to optimize for time and space now,
but after one working solution, try to be as optimal as possible.

Input => 2d array/list
Output => number
